# Embed Code Gradle Plugin

The `io.spine.embed-code` plugin runs Embed Code without requiring developers
or CI jobs to download an executable manually. It selects the released binary
for the current platform, installs it under the project's `build/` directory,
and exposes separate `checkEmbedding` and `embedCode` tasks.

## Apply and Configure

After the plugin is published, apply its released version:

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("io.spine.embed-code") version "<version>"
}
```

Until then, test the plugin directly from this checkout by adding its build to
the consuming project's `settings.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
pluginManagement {
    includeBuild("../embed-code-gradle-plugin")
}
```

The consuming `build.gradle.kts` can then apply `id("io.spine.embed-code")`
without a version while using that included build.

Configure Embed Code directly in `build.gradle.kts`; no `embed-code.yml` file
is required:

```kotlin
embedCode {
    codePath.set(layout.projectDirectory.dir("src/main/java"))
    docsPath.set(layout.projectDirectory.dir("docs"))
    docIncludes.set(listOf("**/*.md", "**/*.html"))
    docExcludes.set(listOf("drafts/**", "generated/**"))
    separator.set("...")
    info.set(false)
    stacktrace.set(false)
}
```

`docsPath` is required. Configure either one unnamed `codePath` or one or more
named sources. By default, the plugin downloads the latest Embed Code release
from GitHub Releases. Plugin and application versions are independent. The
other properties use the same defaults as the Embed Code command-line
application.

| Property                       | Default                        | Purpose                                      |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `version`                      | Latest GitHub release          | Pins a specific executable release when set. |
| `codePath`                     | Required without named sources | Sets one unnamed source root.                |
| `namedSource(name, directory)` | Required without `codePath`    | Adds a `$name/` source root.                 |
| `docsPath`                     | Required                       | Sets the documentation root to scan.         |
| `docIncludes`                  | `**/*.md`, `**/*.html`         | Selects documentation files.                 |
| `docExcludes`                  | Empty                          | Skips matching documentation files.          |
| `separator`                    | `...`                          | Separates joined fragment parts.             |
| `info`                         | `false`                        | Enables informational logging.               |
| `stacktrace`                   | `false`                        | Prints stack traces after panics.            |
| `downloadBaseUrl`              | GitHub Releases                | Selects a release mirror or test repository. |

For reproducible builds, or if the latest CLI release has a problem, pin only
the executable version while keeping the applied plugin version unchanged:

```kotlin
embedCode {
    version.set("1.2.3")
}
```

### Named Source Roots

Use `namedSource` when documentation embeds code from multiple modules:

```kotlin
embedCode {
    namedSource(
        "company-site",
        layout.projectDirectory.dir("company-site"),
    )
    namedSource(
        "jxbrowser",
        layout.projectDirectory.dir("browser"),
    )
    docsPath.set(layout.projectDirectory)
}
```

Embedding instructions select these roots with `$company-site/` and
`$jxbrowser/`. The plugin writes the corresponding Embed Code configuration
into the Gradle task's temporary directory and passes it to the executable;
the project does not need an `embed-code.yml` file.

`codePath` and `namedSource(...)` are mutually exclusive. Multiple independent
documentation targets are not exposed by this Gradle DSL.

## Run

Check that documentation already contains current source snippets:

```bash
./gradlew :checkEmbedding
```

Update documentation in place:

```bash
./gradlew :embedCode
```

Both tasks belong to the `embed code` group. `installEmbedCode` is an ungrouped
internal preparation task, so it is hidden from the normal `tasks` report but
remains visible with `tasks --all`. Gradle runs it automatically before either
execution task. Without an explicit `version`, it downloads the current latest
release on every invocation. A pinned version uses Gradle's normal up-to-date
behavior and reuses its installed executable.

The plugin prefers the `checkEmbedding` and `embedCode` task names. If one is
already occupied, it prepends underscores until it finds an available name, for
example `_checkEmbedding` or `__checkEmbedding`. Existing tasks are unchanged;
use the `tasks` report to see the selected names. The leading `:` in the
commands above selects the root task explicitly; without it, a multi-project
build may also run every subproject task with the same name.

The plugin supports the platforms for which Embed Code currently publishes
release assets:

- Linux AMD64.
- Windows AMD64.
- macOS AMD64 and ARM64.

## Compatibility

The published plugin implementation targets Java 8 bytecode. Compatibility is
tested with Gradle 7.6.3 and the current wrapper version, Gradle 9.6.1. The JVM
used to run Gradle must also satisfy the selected Gradle version's own Java
compatibility requirements.

The plugin build uses Kotlin DSL and Kotlin tests, while its published classes
are Java. Keeping Kotlin 2.x off the consumer plugin classpath allows older
Gradle Kotlin DSL compilers to load the plugin.

The plugin declares support for Gradle's configuration cache. Functional tests
run plugin tasks with `--configuration-cache` and verify cache reuse.

## Develop

Run compilation, plugin validation, unit tests, and TestKit functional tests:

```bash
./gradlew check
```

The functional tests create local fake release assets. They do not download or
execute a real GitHub release.

Publish the current plugin version to the local Maven repository when testing
it from another checkout:

```bash
./gradlew :gradle-plugin:publishToMavenLocal
```

Then make the local repository available to plugin resolution in the consuming
project's `settings.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        mavenLocal()
        gradlePluginPortal()
    }
}
```

The `mavenLocal()` declaration must be in `pluginManagement.repositories`.
Adding it only to the consuming project's regular `repositories` block does not
make locally published Gradle plugin markers available to the `plugins` block.
The consuming build can then apply the locally published version normally:

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("io.spine.embed-code") version "<version>"
}
```

The plugin publication version is configured in `version.gradle.kts`. Embed
Code application versions are resolved independently at execution time.

## Publish

The plugin is configured for the [Gradle Plugin Portal][plugin-portal]. Its
publication version does not need to match an Embed Code application version.
By default, every published plugin version follows the latest stable GitHub
release; consumers can pin an application version through the extension.

Request validation from the Plugin Portal without publishing a version:

```bash
./gradlew :gradle-plugin:publishPlugins --validate-only
```

The Portal task requires API credentials even in validation-only mode. Provide
them through `GRADLE_PUBLISH_KEY` and `GRADLE_PUBLISH_SECRET`. The regular CI
build uses `publishToMavenLocal` instead, which assembles the plugin marker,
implementation publication, POM metadata, sources, and Javadocs without
contacting the Portal.

To publish after validation, run:

```bash
./gradlew :gradle-plugin:publishPlugins
```

The first publication of `io.spine.embed-code` requires manual Portal approval.
The publishing account must be able to establish ownership of the `io.spine`
namespace; this external approval cannot be validated by the local build.
